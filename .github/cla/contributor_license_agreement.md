# **Dataiku Individual Contributor License Agreement**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to open source projects managed or sponsored by Dataiku (“**Dataiku**”).
By submitting a Contribution to a Dataiku open source project, you agree to the terms of this Individual Contributor License Agreement (“**Agreement**”). This Agreement is intended to protect both you as a contributor and Dataiku as the project steward, without limiting your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

## 1. Definitions
“**You**” or “**Your**” means the individual copyright owner or the legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is entering into this Agreement with Dataiku. If You are acting on behalf of a legal entity, “**You**” includes that entity and all entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with it. For purposes of this definition, “control” means direct or indirect ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power or equity interests, or the power to direct management or policies.
“**Contribution**” means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Dataiku for inclusion in, or documentation of, any software, documentation, or other materials managed or distributed by Dataiku (the “**Project**”). A Contribution is considered “**submitted**” when communicated to Dataiku or its representatives through any electronic, verbal, or written means, including but not limited to source code repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, or code review tools managed by or on behalf of Dataiku, unless You clearly mark the communication as “Not a Contribution.”

## 2. Scope of Agreement
This Agreement applies to all Contributions submitted by You to Dataiku, whether submitted before or after the date You first accept this Agreement, unless explicitly stated otherwise in writing by Dataiku.

## 3. Grant of Copyright License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, You hereby grant to Dataiku and to recipients of software distributed by Dataiku a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to: reproduce; prepare derivative works of; publicly display; publicly perform; sublicense; and distribute Your Contributions and any derivative works thereof.

## 4. Grant of Patent License
Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, You hereby grant to Dataiku and to recipients of software distributed by Dataiku a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution alone or by its combination with the Project to which it was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) alleging that a Contribution or the Project infringes a patent, any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Contribution or Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 5. Ownership and Rights Retained
Except for the licenses expressly granted in this Agreement, You retain all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions. Nothing in this Agreement limits Your right to use, modify, distribute, sublicense, or commercialize Your Contributions or derivative works thereof, subject to applicable open source licenses.

## 6. Contributor Representations and Authority
You represent and warrant that:
a. You are legally entitled to grant the licenses set out in this Agreement;
b. Each Contribution is Your original work, except for any third-party materials properly disclosed in accordance with this Agreement;
c. If Your employer, client, or any other entity has or may have intellectual property rights in Your Contributions, You have obtained all necessary permissions, waivers, or authorizations to submit the Contributions and grant the licenses described herein;
d. If You are acting on behalf of a legal entity, You have the authority to bind that entity to the terms of this Agreement.

## 7. Contributions on Behalf of Third Parties
If You submit material that is not Your original creation, You must retain all applicable copyright and license notices; clearly identify the third-party source and applicable license or restriction; and conspicuously mark the submission as: “Submitted on behalf of a third party: [name].”.

## 8. Duty to Disclose and Notify
You agree to promptly notify Dataiku if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make any representation or warranty in this Agreement inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading, including with respect to third-party intellectual property rights.

## 9. No Support Obligation
You are not obligated to provide maintenance, support, updates, or enhancements for Your Contributions, unless You separately agree to do so in writing.

## 10. Disclaimer of Warranty
Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an “AS IS” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, or non-infringement.

## 11. Public Nature of Contributions
You acknowledge that Contributions are public and that a record of Contributions, including your name, username, email address, IP address, timestamps, and associated metadata, may be maintained for as long as necessary for Dataiku to establish, exercise, or defend legal rights, and may be publicly disclosed as part of the Project history, in accordance with applicable open source licenses, and to the extent permitted by applicable law.

## 12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

12.1. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of New York, USA, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. 

12.2. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New York, New York.

## 13. Entire Agreement; Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
